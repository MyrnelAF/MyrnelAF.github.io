I am an MS Chemistry student at the University of the Philippines Diliman, College of Science, Institute of Chemistry, supervised by Dr. Ricky B. Nellas. My undergraduate degree in Industrial Pharmacy from the University of the Philippines Manila focused on medicinal chemistry, drug design, and formulation. My thesis explored the effects of temperature and humidity on amoxicillin tablets, addressing issues of misuse and improper storage in the Philippines.

After obtaining my pharmacy license, I worked in the industry for nearly two years before transitioning to research. I initially joined Dr. Aaron Villaraza's peptide synthesis lab but shifted to computational chemistry after an internship with Dr. Ricky. I joined his lab in early 2021 to study cancer pathways, particularly the MAPK pathway, and identify novel drugs for the NRAS GTPase.

**Side Projects**  
In 2023, I led our lab's protein engineering project, training two undergraduate interns. I published a paper on the [reverse engineering of bacterial PAL lipase](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0003986124003485).

I am an MS Chemistry student at the University of the Philippines Diliman, College of Science, Institute of Chemistry. I work under the supervision of Dr. Ricky B. Nellas. I initially joined the peptide synthesis group of Dr. Aaron Villaraza but found my way to Computational Chemistry through Dr. Ricky. I joined his laboratory in Q1 2021 wherein I started studying cancer pathways, specifically the MAPK pathway in hopes of identifying new drugs for the NRas GTPase. I started working as a research assistant under the DDHP Program of the Department of the Science and Technology under Project 6 where I did computer-aided drug design studies for anti-cancer treatment. Aside from working with our lead drug with organic chemists from the group of Dr. Monissa Paderes, I explored other lead compounds as well as did n novel binding site search using MD simulations for several cancer targets such as the HSP90. Through the program, I introduced Network Pharmacology to the lab and have since presented one poster and one oral presentation to local chemists at the Philippine Chemistry Congress.

I am an MS Chemistry student at the University of the Philippines Diliman, College of Science, Institute of Chemistry. I work under the supervision of Dr. Ricky B. Nellas. I obtained my undergraduate degree on Industrial Pharmacy at the University of the Philippines Manila where I was trained in medicinal chemistry, drug design, and drug formulation. My undergraduate thesis investigated the effects of varying temperatures and relative humidities of the Philippines to amoxicillin tablets, a frequently misused and improperly stored drugs in the country. After obtaining my pharmacy license, I worked at the industry for almost two years before deciding to enter obtain a Master's degree and going into the field of research.

I initially joined the peptide synthesis lab of Dr. Aaron Villaraza but found my way to Computational Chemistry after a short internship offered by Dr. Ricky. I joined his laboratory in Q1 2021 where I started studying cancer pathways, specifically the MAPK pathway in hopes of identifying new drugs for the NRas GTPase. 

I started working as a research assistant under the Department of Science and Technology â€“ Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), the Discovery and Development of Health Products (DDHP) program under Project 6 where I did computer-aided drug design studies for anti-cancer lead compounds. Aside from working on our lead compound with organic chemists from the group of Dr. Monissa Paderes, I did novel binding site search using MD simulations for several cancer targets such as the HSP90. Through the program, I introduced Network Pharmacology to the lab and have since presented one poster and one oral presentation to local chemists at the Philippine Chemistry Congress.

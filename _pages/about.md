I am an MS Chemistry student at the University of the Philippines Diliman, College of Science, Institute of Chemistry. I work under the supervision of Dr. Ricky B. Nellas. I obtained my undergraduate degree in Industrial Pharmacy at the University of the Philippines Manila. I trained in medicinal chemistry, drug design, and drug formulation. My undergraduate thesis investigated the effects of varying temperatures and relative humidities of the Philippines on amoxicillin tablets, frequently misused and improperly stored drugs in the country. After obtaining my pharmacy license, I worked in the industry for almost two years before deciding to get a Master's degree and go into the field of research.

I initially joined Dr. Aaron Villaraza's peptide synthesis lab but found my way to Computational Chemistry after a short internship offered by Dr. Ricky. I joined his laboratory in Q1 2021, studying cancer pathways, specifically the MAPK pathway, to identify new drugs for the NRAS GTPase. 

I started working as a research assistant under the Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), the Discovery and Development of Health Products (DDHP) program under Project 6 (Computer-Aided Drug Design of Natural Products-Based, and Synthetic Antidiabetic, Antifungal, and Anticancer Lead Compounds and Derivatives) where I did computer-aided drug design studies for anticancer lead compounds. Aside from working on our lead compound with organic chemists from the group of Dr. Monissa Paderes, I did a novel binding site search using MD simulations for several cancer targets, such as the HSP90, androgen receptor, and the estrogen receptor. Through the program, I introduced Network Pharmacology to the lab and have since presented one poster and one oral presentation to local chemists at the Philippine Chemistry Congress. The DDHP project thus gave me experience in computational drug repurposing.

After the DDHP program ended, I joined the DOST Technical Battle Against COVID-19, where I did computer-aided drug design studies on the different variants of the virus. I worked with experimentalists to check the binding affinities of the compounds they synthesized. I used CGMD to get ensembles, molecular docking, and mm-gbsa to calculate the binding free energies of the top compounds identified through bioassays. In addition, I helped create an in-house library to expand the chemical space of compounds with potential activity against COVID-19. A research paper from this is being drafted with the Molecular Endocrinology Laboratory of the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (NIMBB). 

Additional work I did for the COVID-19 project included the biophysical analyses of the spike protein to identify the effects of glycans on the system's dynamics. A research paper from this study was submitted to Scientific Reports, which is currently under review. I also designed the [supplementary journal cover](https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsodf.2023.8.issue-48/asset/acsodf.2023.8.issue-48.largecover-2.jpg) of a [published paper](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.3c04007) under the program.

My current research at the UST Research Center for the Natural Sciences and Applied Sciences (RCNAS) under the supervision of Assistant Professor Leonardo A. Guevarra Jr. is on spider venoms from Philippine spider species. I am conducting peptide modeling for the project and investigating their binding to ion channels. Currently, I am applying steered MD simulations to understand the behavior of spider venom peptides in crossing lipid membranes and their dynamics upon binding to ion channels.

**Side Projects.** In 2023, I took over our lab's Protein Engineering side project, with my initial training under Dr. Ricky and Jadriel Meg Cabanding. I trained two undergraduate interns and drafted my first [first-author paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4699457), which is under review in Computational and Theoretical Chemistry.

**Research Interests.** Computer-Aided Drug Design, Computional Biophysical Analysis, Protein- Engineering of Industrial Enzymes, Peptide Folding, Ion Channels!

**Relevant Courses Taken.** (Chem 359, Institute of Chemistry, UPD) Biophysical Analysis under Dr. Ricky B. Nellas, (Math 236, Institute of Math, UPD) Chemical Reaction Networks under Dr. Byran Hernandez, (MBB 390, National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology, UPD) Systems Biology and Introduction to Bioinformatics under Dr. Isaiah Lee.

**Relevant Trainings and Workshops.**  _10th Annual CCPBioSim & MGMS 2024 Conference_: Molecular modelling in structure-based drug design; _Hybrid Hünfeld Workshop 2024_: Computer Simulation and Theory of Macromolecules - Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences; _EU-ASEAN HPC School 2023_, BRIN, Bogor, Indonesia; _UNHAN Quantum and Qiskit Workshop 2023_, Jakarta, Indonesia; _Hybrid Hünfeld Workshop 2022_: Computer Simulation and Theory of Macromolecules - Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences.

**Misc Lab activities.** I like tinkering with shell and Python scripts to automate analysis. I want to make terminal navigation more efficient by playing with aliases. I enjoy creating pretty graphs using Mathematica (shoutout to my husband [Sean Julian C. Fortuna](https://github.com/slashdotfield) for the training). I like using Blender to make pretty visuals for our posters and oral presentations. I created our [lab website](https://goodvibeslab-upd.github.io//goodvibeslab-upd/), which is still under construction. After completing the EU-HPC School last 2023, I introduced the lab to the [FAIR principles](https://www.openaire.eu/how-to-make-your-data-fair) and thus opened and currently manage our lab's [GitHub account](https://github.com/goodvibeslab-upd).

**Outside the Lab.** Outside the lab, I spend time with my husband and three cats. We usually host board game sessions when we're not busy. I am also a ranger in my current D&D campaign. I listen to Warhammer 40k podcasts (shoutout to [Lorecrimes](https://rss.com/podcasts/lorecrimes/), who helped me through several work sessions). I do a lot of crocheting, watercolor painting, and photography. This template suggested I post a favorite subreddit, and mine is [r/learnMath](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/) since I'm a chemist trying to improve my maths.

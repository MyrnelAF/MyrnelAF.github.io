<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am an MS Chemistry student at the University of the Philippines Diliman, College of Science, Institute of Chemistry. I work under the supervision of Dr. Ricky B. Nellas. I obtained my undergraduate degree in Industrial Pharmacy at the University of the Philippines Manila. I trained in medicinal chemistry, drug design, and drug formulation. My undergraduate thesis investigated the effects of varying temperatures and relative humidities of the Philippines on amoxicillin tablets, frequently misused and improperly stored drugs in the country. After obtaining my pharmacy license, I worked in the industry for almost two years before deciding to get a Master’s degree and go into the field of research.</p> <p>I initially joined Dr. Aaron Villaraza’s peptide synthesis lab but found my way to Computational Chemistry after a short internship offered by Dr. Ricky. I joined his laboratory in Q1 2021, studying cancer pathways, specifically the MAPK pathway, to identify new drugs for the NRAS GTPase.</p> <p>I started working as a research assistant under the Department of Science and Technology – Philippine Council for Health Research and Development (DOST-PCHRD), the Discovery and Development of Health Products (DDHP) program under Project 6 (Computer-Aided Drug Design of Natural Products-Based, and Synthetic Antidiabetic, Antifungal, and Anticancer Lead Compounds and Derivatives) where I did computer-aided drug design studies for anticancer lead compounds. Aside from working on our lead compound with organic chemists from the group of Dr. Monissa Paderes, I did a novel binding site search using MD simulations for several cancer targets, such as the HSP90. Through the program, I introduced Network Pharmacology to the lab and have since presented one poster and one oral presentation to local chemists at the Philippine Chemistry Congress.</p> <p>After the DDHP program ended, I joined the DOST Technical Battle Against COVID-19, where I did computer-aided drug design studies on the different variants of the virus. I worked with experimentalists to design and synthesize 28 compounds against the virus, three of which were found to be active against the omicron BA.2 variant. A research paper from this is being drafted with the Molecular Endocrinology Laboratory of the National Institute of Molecular Biology and Biotechnology (NIMBB). Aside from this, I performed biophysical analyses of the spike protein to identify the effects of glycans on the system’s dynamics. A research paper from this study was submitted to the Scientific Reports journal, which is currently under review. I also designed the <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/cms/10.1021/acsodf.2023.8.issue-48/asset/acsodf.2023.8.issue-48.xlargecover-2.jpg" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">supplementary journal cover</a> of a <a href="(https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsomega.3c04007)">published paper</a> under the program.</p> <p>My current research at the UST Research Center for the Natural Sciences and Applied Sciences (RCNAS) under the supervision of Assistant Professor Leonardo A. Guevarra Jr. is on spider venoms from Philippine spider species. I am conducting peptide modeling for the project and investigating their binding to ion channels. Currently, I am applying MD simulations to understand the behavior of spider venom peptides in crossing lipid membranes and their dynamics upon binding to ion channels.</p> <p>Outside the lab, I spend time with my husband and three cats. We usually host board game sessions when we’re not busy. I am also a ranger in my current D&amp;D campaign. I listen to Warhammer 40k podcasts (shoutout to <a href="https://rss.com/podcasts/lorecrimes/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lorecrimes</a>, who helped me through several work sessions). I do a lot of crocheting, watercolor painting, and photography. This template suggested I post a favorite subreddit, and mine is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmath/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">r/learnMath</a> since I’m a chemist trying best to improve my maths.</p> </body></html>
